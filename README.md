   - This field should be enclosed in a form.

-  Accommodation and Activity Cards :
   - Each accommodation or activity card should be clickable in its entirety (not just the title).

-  Search Filters :
   - Accommodations can be filtered by themes such as budget or ambiance.
   - The filters should change color on mouse hover.
   - The filters do not need to be functional - this is just a first version to validate the interface.

   - No specific IDE or code editor is required for development.
   - The code must be valid according to the W3C HTML and CSS validators.
   - HTML code must not contain any CSS properties.

   - The web page should be tested on these two browsers.
